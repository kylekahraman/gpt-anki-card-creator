On one side, we have motor neurons sending signals from the brain to the body. Think of them as the delivery trucks, carrying instructions for movement and action. \n",

      "But here’s the twist! The cell body of these motor neurons can be located at different levels of the spinal cord, sending their axons down to exit the spinal cord through the spinal nerves. This is how your brain communicates with your muscles to make things happen, whether that’s throwing a ball or just wiggling your toes!\n",

Here’s where it gets interesting: the cell bodies of these sensory neurons are located in a structure called the dorsal root ganglion. Instead of having a bunch of dendrites like motor neurons, sensory neurons are known as pseudo-unipolar neurons. \n",

      "What does that mean? Well, they have one long neurite that splits into two branches. One branch gathers information from the body, while the other sends it to the spinal cord and eventually to the brain.
